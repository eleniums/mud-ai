Welcome to |gVorvania|n, a Multi-User Dungeon (MUD) with content created almost
exclusively by AI. The Large Language Model (LLM) being used is GPT4-x-Alpaca
and is hosted using Oobabooga.

The initial starting room is Limbo and below you will find a description of this
mysterious place. There's a |wportal|n nearby that you can use to exit and begin
your adventure. The command |wlook portal|n will print a description of the
portal and |wlook|n can be used to examine other things as well. Type |wportal|n
to enter the portal and begin your journey.

Once you have entered the world, you will be able to move around using
directional commands, like |weast|n, |wwest|n, |wnorth|n, or |wsouth|n. The
world you will explore has not been fully discovered yet. If you journey to an
area that no adventurer has been to before, the AI will generate a new room for
you to explore and then it will be available for other people to visit as well.

If ever you find yourself lost and would like to return to the starting point,
type |wteleport home|n.

And now...

You find yourself in a shadowy plane of existence where the laws of physics and
morality seemingly dissolve. Here, in this eerie limbo, spirits and entities
roam freely, existing between the cracks of time. Shadows lengthen without the
influence of the sun and whispers carry through the void, echoing the hollow
histories of those who once walked the earth.

venture beyond the veil. Step through the shimmering |wportal|n, and let the
unknown awaken your senses, stirring a hunger within you that can only be
satiated by the exploration of the extraordinary.

# Add a description to the Castle
@desc
Nestled at the confluence of four distinct terrains lies a majestic castle. At
its feet, a verdant forest thrives, rich with foliage and the songs of woodland
creatures. Beyond the stone walls, the desert's golden horizon calls forth, its
heat radiating against the cool facade of the castle. Mountain peaks loom in the
distance, their snowcapped summits a testament to the earth's might. Finally,
the swamp's murky waters encircle the castle, their dark reflections reflecting
the mysterious and ancient history tied to the site.

You stand in the castle courtyard. It is a vibrant hub of activity, surrounded
by towering spires and ornate turrets. The air buzzes with energy as nobles and
commoners alike gather to do business. The cobblestone ground is littered with
the clatter of hooves and the jostling of wagons, transporting goods and
passengers to and from the city. The scent of freshly baked bread and savory
roasted meats fills the air, intermingled with the pungent odors of livestock
and musty stables. Colorful banners flap lazily above, flaunting the insignias
of noble houses and serving as a backdrop to the ebb and flow of courtly
affairs.

To the |weast|n, you see a lush forest.
To the |wwest|n, you see a blazing desert.
To the |wnorth|n, you see snow-capped mountains.
To the |wsouth|n, you see a decaying swamp.
